# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features using Python and scikit-learn. Ideal for learning regression and model evaluation techniques.

# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project is a **machine learning model** designed to predict house prices based on various input features like location, size, number of rooms, and more. Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn**, it's a great demonstration of regression techniques in real estate pricing.
